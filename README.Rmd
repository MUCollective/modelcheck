# Modelcheck: An R package for generating model check visualization

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`modelcheck` is a visualization grammar designed to make it easy to generate informative visualizations for model checking. The `modelcheck` grammar assumes a basic workflow for creating model checks. First, the model predictions or model features need to be extracted as a **distribution** of data from a model object, i.e. data tidying. Then the user must specify an **uncertainty representation** to describe the selected distribution(s). They must also specify the presentation of the observed data. The user can choose among multiple **comparative layouts** to structure their comparison between observed data and model predictions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of modelcheck from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MUCollective/modelcheck")
```

## Usage

### Background: model

We use a simple model to show the usage of `modelcheck`.

```{r}
library(brms)
model = brm(
  bf(mpg ~ disp + vs + am),
  init = "0",
  data = mtcars,
  iter = 6000,
  
  file = "models/example_model.rds" # cache model (can be removed)  
)
```

The results...

```{r}
model
```

### Examples

You can create a default model check to do posterior predictive check by `mcplot()` (using `coord_flip()` to flip response variable to x axis).

```{r}
library(modelcheck)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
model %>%
  mcplot() +
  mc_gglayer(coord_flip())
```

To control the way to draw distribution from model, you can add a `mc_distribution()` to `mcplot()`. Here, we are drawing the posterior distribution of `mu` from the Gaussian model we define earlier.

```{r}
model %>%
  mcplot() +
  mc_distribution("mu") +
  mc_gglayer(coord_flip())
```

To add marginal effects check, you can use `mc_condition_on()` to add x axis, row grids, and column grids.

```{r}
model %>%
  mcplot() +
  mc_distribution("mu") +
  mc_condition_on(x = vars(disp))
```

Now you may find the distribution of `mpg` margining on `disp` is a little hard to see. Then you can use `mc_model_lineribbon()` to use line + ribbon plot to show the uncertainty of model.

```{r}
model %>%
  mcplot() +
  mc_distribution("mu", ndraws = 500) +
  mc_condition_on(x = vars(disp)) +
  mc_model_lineribbon()
```

`mcplot()` puts the model predictions and data observations superposed by default. You can change that by using `mc_layout_*()`. Here we change the comparative layout into juxtaposition.

```{r}
model %>%
  mcplot() +
  mc_distribution("mu", ndraws = 500) +
  mc_condition_on(x = vars(disp)) +
  mc_model_lineribbon() +
  mc_layout_juxtaposition()
```
